# This script is designed to be run in a CI environment to:
# 1. Execute all sample code
# 2. Generate execution result reports
# 3. Detect errors in sample scripts due to specification changes
# 4. Use LLM to generate fix proposals for broken samples
# 5. Add PR comments with reports and fix proposals
